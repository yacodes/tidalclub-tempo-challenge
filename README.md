# Tidal Club Tempo Challenge

> Ok here's challenge number one - record two pieces!
>
> First, make some patterns at a tempo you like, say setcps 0.8, and record them for 2-3 minutes. They don't have to be complicated, but while you record, tweak some parameters, to give the recording some shape.
> 
> Then make a big tempo change, maybe even as much as doubling or halving the tempo, i.e. setcps 0.4 or setcps 1.6.
> 
> Then work with the patterns for a while, until they work well with the tempo, and record that, again while tweaking the patterns a little.
>
> Then compare them, thinking about the difference that tempo makes to the rhythms that you're working with. Next, leave them some hours, maybe even sleep on it and come back to them the next day. Listen again, without thinking about the code. Do they sound different, if so how? What would you do differently next time?
